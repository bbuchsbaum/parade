## Quick Start (5 minutes)

Want to see parade in action? Here's a complete working example:

```r
library(parade)

# 1. Define what varies (3 subjects × 2 conditions = 6 analyses)
grid <- param_grid(
  subject = c("s01", "s02", "s03"),
  condition = c("A", "B")
)

# 2. Create workflow with one analysis step
workflow <- flow(grid) |>
  stage(
    id = "analyze",
    f = function(subject, condition) {
      # Your analysis code here
      score <- rnorm(1, mean = 100, sd = 15)
      list(score = score)
    },
    schema = returns(score = dbl())
  )

# 3. Run it!
results <- collect(workflow)
print(results)
# A tibble: 6 × 4
#   subject condition score   .ok
#   <chr>   <chr>     <dbl> <lgl>
# 1 s01     A          98.2  TRUE
# 2 s01     B         102.4  TRUE
# ... (4 more rows)
```

That's it! You've just run 6 analyses automatically. Read on to understand how parade can scale from this simple example to complex, multi-stage pipelines on HPC clusters.

## Why parade? A simple research scenario

Imagine you're analyzing experimental data from multiple participants. You need to:

1. Load each participant's data file
2. Clean and preprocess the data
3. Run your analysis
4. Generate summary statistics

With 20 participants and 3 experimental conditions, that's 60 separate analyses. You could write nested loops, manage file paths manually, and hope nothing crashes halfway through. Or you could use **parade** to declare your workflow once and let it handle the complexity.

## What is parade?

**parade** helps you build reproducible analysis pipelines that can run on everything from your laptop to a computing cluster. Instead of writing loops and managing files manually, you:

1. **Declare** what you want to compute
2. **Define** the steps and their relationships
3. **Execute** locally or in parallel
4. **Collect** validated, organized results

Let's see how this works with a concrete example.

## Your first parade workflow

> **Reproducibility tip**: When generating synthetic data for examples, always use `set.seed()` to ensure outputs remain consistent across runs. In production code, you typically wouldn't set seeds unless you need reproducible randomization.

### Step 1: Define your parameter space

Every parade workflow starts with a **parameter grid** - a table that defines all the analyses you want to run:

```r
library(parade)
library(progressr)  # For progress bars

# Initialize parade's path system for managing artifacts and registries
# This creates directories for storing intermediate results and job metadata
paths_init()

# Define what varies in your analysis
grid <- param_grid(
  participant = c("p01", "p02", "p03"),  # 3 participants
  condition = c("control", "treatment")   # 2 conditions
)

print(grid)
# A tibble: 6 × 2
#   participant condition
#   <chr>       <chr>    
# 1 p01         control  
# 2 p01         treatment
# 3 p02         control  
# 4 p02         treatment
# 5 p03         control  
# 6 p03         treatment
```

Each row in this grid represents one analysis we need to run. Parade will handle all 6 automatically.

### Step 2: Define your analysis pipeline

Now we create a **flow** - a series of computational steps that will be applied to each row:

```r
# Create a flow from our parameter grid
results_flow <- flow(grid) |>
  
  # First stage: Load the data
  stage(
    id = "load",  # Give this stage a name for reference
    f = function(participant, condition) {
      # This function receives parameters for one row of the grid
      # In production, you would typically:
      # data <- read.csv(sprintf("data/%s_%s.csv", participant, condition))
      
      # For this example, we simulate data
      # Use participant/condition as seed components for reproducible but varied data
      seed_val <- as.numeric(factor(participant)) * 100 + 
                  as.numeric(factor(condition))
      set.seed(seed_val)
      
      n_trials <- 100
      # Simulate reaction time experiment data
      data <- data.frame(
        participant = participant,
        condition = condition,
        trial = 1:n_trials,
        response_time = rnorm(n_trials, 
                             mean = ifelse(condition == "control", 500, 450), 
                             sd = 50),
        accuracy = rbinom(n_trials, 1, 
                         prob = ifelse(condition == "control", 0.8, 0.9))
      )
      
      # Stages must return a list
      list(data = data)
    },
    # Tell parade what type of output to expect
    schema = returns(data = lst())
  )
```

Let's break this down:
- **`flow(grid)`** creates a workflow that will process each row of our grid
- **`stage()`** adds a computational step to the workflow
- **`id`** gives the stage a name so other stages can reference it
- **`f`** is the function that does the actual work
- **`schema`** tells parade what kind of data this stage produces

### Step 3: Add analysis stages

Let's add a stage that analyzes the loaded data:

```r
results_flow <- results_flow |>
  
  # Second stage: Analyze the data
  stage(
    id = "analyze",
    needs = "load",  # This stage needs the output from "load"
    f = function(load.data) {
      # Notice: load.data refers to the 'data' output from the 'load' stage
      
      # Calculate summary statistics
      mean_rt <- mean(load.data$response_time)
      sd_rt <- sd(load.data$response_time)
      accuracy <- mean(load.data$accuracy)
      n_trials <- nrow(load.data)
      
      list(
        mean_rt = mean_rt,
        sd_rt = sd_rt,
        accuracy = accuracy,
        n_trials = n_trials
      )
    },
    # Specify the types of our outputs
    schema = returns(
      mean_rt = dbl(),   # Double/numeric
      sd_rt = dbl(),
      accuracy = dbl(),
      n_trials = int()   # Integer
    )
  )
```

Key points:
- **`needs = "load"`** creates a dependency - this stage waits for "load" to complete
- **`load.data`** is how we access the output from the previous stage
- The naming convention is: `[stage_name].[output_field]`

### Step 4: Execute and collect results

Now we run the entire workflow:

```r
# Execute the workflow
results <- collect(results_flow)

print(results)
# A tibble: 6 × 7
#   participant condition mean_rt  sd_rt accuracy n_trials  .ok
#   <chr>       <chr>       <dbl>  <dbl>    <dbl>    <int> <lgl>
# 1 p01         control      498.   48.2     0.79      100 TRUE
# 2 p01         treatment    451.   51.3     0.91      100 TRUE
# 3 p02         control      502.   49.8     0.81      100 TRUE
# 4 p02         treatment    449.   50.1     0.88      100 TRUE
# 5 p03         control      499.   52.1     0.80      100 TRUE
# 6 p03         treatment    448.   47.9     0.92      100 TRUE
```

The results include:
- Our original parameters (`participant`, `condition`)
- The outputs from our analysis stage (`mean_rt`, `sd_rt`, `accuracy`, `n_trials`)
- A `.ok` column indicating whether each row succeeded

## Understanding schemas and types

You might wonder why we specify schemas. They serve three important purposes:

### 1. Early error detection

```r
# This will fail immediately if your function returns the wrong type
stage(
  id = "bad_stage",
  f = function() {
    list(result = "not a number")  # Oops, returning string instead of number
  },
  schema = returns(result = dbl())  # Expected a number!
)
```

### 2. Memory optimization

Parade pre-allocates memory based on your schemas, making execution more efficient.

### 3. Documentation

Schemas make your pipeline's expectations explicit - anyone reading your code knows exactly what each stage produces.

### Available types

```r
# Basic types
dbl()    # Double/numeric values
int()    # Integers
chr()    # Character strings
lgl()    # Logical (TRUE/FALSE)

# Container types
lst()    # Lists (for complex objects)
tbl()    # Tibbles/data frames

# Special types
artifact()  # File references (for large data saved to disk)
```

## Parallel execution

So far, our workflow runs sequentially. Let's make it parallel:

```r
# Run with parallel workers
results_parallel <- collect(
  results_flow, 
  engine = "future",  # Use parallel execution
  workers = 3         # Use 3 parallel workers
)
```

Parade automatically distributes the 6 analyses across the 3 workers, handling all the complexity of parallel execution for you.

### When to use parallel execution

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| < 10 quick analyses | Sequential (easier debugging) |
| Many independent analyses | Parallel with multiple workers |
| Memory-intensive analyses | Parallel with fewer workers |
| Testing/debugging | Always start sequential |

## Handling failures gracefully

Real analyses sometimes fail. Parade provides several strategies:

```r
# Option 1: Keep failed rows in results (default)
flow_robust <- flow(grid, error = "keep")

# Option 2: Stop on first error (for debugging)
flow_strict <- flow(grid, error = "stop")

# Option 3: Silently remove failed rows
flow_filter <- flow(grid, error = "omit")

# Check which rows failed
failed_rows <- failed(results)

# Get detailed error information
diagnostics(results, stage = "analyze")
```

## Building complex pipelines

Stages can depend on multiple previous stages, creating a directed acyclic graph (DAG):

```r
complex_flow <- flow(grid) |>
  
  stage(id = "load", 
        f = function(participant, condition) {
          # Load raw data from CSV files
          # Using resolve_path() for parade's path management
          file_path <- sprintf("data/%s_%s.csv", participant, condition)
          
          # For this example, simulate loading data
          set.seed(as.numeric(factor(participant)) * 100 + 
                   as.numeric(factor(condition)))
          
          raw_data <- data.frame(
            x = rnorm(100),
            y = rnorm(100),
            participant = participant,
            condition = condition
          )
          
          list(raw_data = raw_data)
        },
        schema = returns(raw_data = lst())) |>
  
  stage(id = "clean",
        needs = "load",
        f = function(load.raw_data) {
          # Remove outliers: values > 3 SD from mean
          clean_data <- load.raw_data
          
          # Remove outliers from x variable
          x_mean <- mean(clean_data$x, na.rm = TRUE)
          x_sd <- sd(clean_data$x, na.rm = TRUE)
          clean_data <- clean_data[abs(clean_data$x - x_mean) <= 3 * x_sd, ]
          
          # Remove outliers from y variable  
          y_mean <- mean(clean_data$y, na.rm = TRUE)
          y_sd <- sd(clean_data$y, na.rm = TRUE)
          clean_data <- clean_data[abs(clean_data$y - y_mean) <= 3 * y_sd, ]
          
          list(clean_data = clean_data)
        },
        schema = returns(clean_data = lst())) |>
  
  stage(id = "model",
        needs = "clean",
        f = function(clean.clean_data) {
          # Fit a linear model
          model <- lm(y ~ x, data = clean.clean_data)
          list(model = model)
        },
        schema = returns(model = lst())) |>
  
  stage(id = "validate",
        needs = "model",
        f = function(model.model) {
          # Simple cross-validation: calculate R-squared
          # In production, use caret::train() or mlr3 for proper CV
          
          # Extract R-squared as a simple validation metric
          cv_score <- summary(model.model)$r.squared
          
          list(cv_score = cv_score)
        },
        schema = returns(cv_score = dbl())) |>
  
  stage(id = "report",
        needs = c("model", "validate"),  # Depends on TWO stages
        f = function(model.model, validate.cv_score) {
          # Generate summary report combining model and validation
          summary_report <- list(
            coefficients = coef(model.model),
            r_squared = cv_score,
            n_obs = length(model.model$fitted.values),
            rmse = sqrt(mean(model.model$residuals^2))
          )
          
          list(summary = summary_report)
        },
        schema = returns(summary = lst()))
```

Parade automatically figures out the execution order based on dependencies.

## Debugging workflows

Start small and build up:

```r
# 1. Test with just 2 rows first
test_results <- collect(results_flow, limit = 2)

# Check if everything worked
if (all(test_results$.ok)) {
  message("Test successful! Now try full dataset.")
} else {
  # Find which rows failed
  failed_rows <- test_results[!test_results$.ok, ]
  print(failed_rows)
}

# 2. Run sequentially for easier debugging
debug_results <- collect(results_flow, engine = "sequential")

# 3. Check intermediate outputs from specific stages
stage_outputs <- diagnostics(test_results)

# Examine what the load stage produced for the first row
print(stage_outputs$load[[1]])  
# $data
# A data frame with 100 rows and 5 columns

# Check analyze stage output
print(stage_outputs$analyze[[1]])
# $mean_rt
# [1] 498.2
# $sd_rt  
# [1] 48.2
# ... etc

# 4. Inspect the flow structure
explain(results_flow)  
# Shows DAG with stages and dependencies:
# Stage 'load' (no dependencies)
# Stage 'analyze' (depends on: load)

# 5. Debug a specific failure
if (!test_results$.ok[1]) {
  # Get detailed error for first row
  error_info <- diagnostics(test_results, row = 1)
  print(error_info$.error)  # See exact error message
}
```

## Common patterns and tips

### Pattern 1: Conditional execution

Skip stages based on conditions:

```r
flow_with_skip <- flow(grid) |>
  stage(id = "load", ...) |>
  stage(
    id = "optional_analysis",
    needs = "load",
    f = function(load.data) {
      # Complex analysis
      list(result = complex_calculation(load.data))
    },
    skip_when = function(load.data) {
      nrow(load.data) < 10  # Skip if too little data
    },
    schema = returns(result = dbl())
  )
```

### Pattern 2: Reproducible randomness

Use a seed column for reproducible random operations:

```r
# Create grid with unique seeds for each analysis
grid_with_seeds <- param_grid(
  participant = c("p01", "p02"),
  replicate = 1:10
) |>
  mutate(seed = 1000 + row_number())  # Add unique seed column

# Tell flow to use the seed column
flow_reproducible <- flow(grid_with_seeds, seed_col = "seed") |>
  stage(
    id = "bootstrap",
    f = function(participant, replicate) {
      # No need to call set.seed() - parade handles it!
      # Each row gets its designated seed automatically
      
      # Simulate some data for this participant
      original_data <- rnorm(100, mean = 100, sd = 15)
      
      # Bootstrap sampling (will be reproducible)
      sample_data <- sample(original_data, replace = TRUE)
      
      list(bootstrap_mean = mean(sample_data))
    },
    schema = returns(bootstrap_mean = dbl())
  )

# Results will be identical every time you run this
results1 <- collect(flow_reproducible)
results2 <- collect(flow_reproducible)
identical(results1$bootstrap_mean, results2$bootstrap_mean)  # TRUE
```

### Pattern 3: Working with complex objects

For complex objects (models, custom classes, neuroimaging data), use `lst()`:

```r
model_flow <- flow(grid) |>
  stage(
    id = "fit_model",
    f = function(participant) {
      # Simulate loading participant data
      # In production: data <- read.csv(sprintf("data/%s.csv", participant))
      set.seed(as.numeric(factor(participant)))
      n <- 100
      data <- data.frame(
        x1 = rnorm(n),
        x2 = rnorm(n),
        x3 = rnorm(n),
        y = rnorm(n)
      )
      
      # Fit a complex model
      model <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3, data = data)
      
      # Return both the model object and extracted metrics
      list(
        model = model,                          # Complex object stored as list
        r_squared = summary(model)$r.squared,   # Simple numeric value
        n_params = length(coef(model))          # Simple integer value
      )
    },
    schema = returns(
      model = lst(),      # List column for complex object
      r_squared = dbl(),  # Regular column for numeric
      n_params = int()    # Regular column for integer
    )
  )
```

## Troubleshooting common issues

### Schema mismatches

```r
# Error: Expected <dbl>, got <int>
# Solution: Use the correct type or convert in your function
schema = returns(value = dbl())  # Not int()
# Or in your function: as.double(your_integer)
```

### Can't find stage output

```r
# Error: Can't find prep.df
# Check:
# 1. Stage name: needs = "prep"  (must match stage id)
# 2. Output name: function(prep.df)  (format: stage.field)
# 3. The prep stage must output a field called "df"
```

### Memory issues with parallel execution

```r
# If you run out of memory with many workers
results <- collect(flow, workers = 2)  # Reduce worker count

# Or process in batches
batch1 <- collect(flow[1:100, ])   # First 100 rows
batch2 <- collect(flow[101:200, ]) # Next 100 rows
```

### Debugging failed rows

```r
# Get detailed information about failures
results <- collect(flow, error = "keep")

# Which rows failed?
failed_rows <- results[!results$.ok, ]

# Why did they fail?
error_details <- diagnostics(results)
print(error_details$.error)  # See error messages
```

## Next steps

Now that you understand the basics:

1. **[Paths System](parade-paths.html)**: Learn about parade's URI-based path management system
2. **[Sinks and Artifacts](parade-sinks.html)**: Save intermediate results to disk automatically
3. **[Artifacts Guide](parade-artifacts.html)**: Practical guide to portable scratch-first storage
4. **[Parallel Execution](parade-mirai.html)**: Scale to hundreds of workers with the mirai backend
5. **[SLURM Distribution](parade-slurm-distribution.html)**: Run on HPC clusters

Remember: start simple, test with small parameter grids, and gradually scale up. Parade grows with your needs - the same code that runs on your laptop can scale to a supercomputer with just a configuration change.

## Summary

parade helps you:
- **Define once, run many**: Write your analysis once, run it across all parameter combinations
- **Handle complexity**: Automatically manage dependencies between analysis steps
- **Scale effortlessly**: From sequential laptop execution to parallel cluster computing
- **Catch errors early**: Type checking prevents silent failures
- **Stay organized**: All results in a clean, typed tibble

Start with simple sequential workflows, add types for safety, then scale to parallel execution when needed. Your analysis code stays the same - only the execution strategy changes.
