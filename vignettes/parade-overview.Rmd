Introduction
------------

Parade is a small framework for building typed, parallel dataflows in R.
It wraps future/furrr for local parallelism, adds backends for SLURM and
mirai, and provides a unified, ergonomic interface to submit, monitor,
and collect results — with optional artifact sinks and typed schemas.

What you get
------------

- Flows and stages: Compose small, pure functions over a parameter grid.
- Distribution: Run locally (future), via SLURM (batchtools), or mirai.
- Deferred execution: `submit()` → `deferred_await()` → `deferred_collect()`.
- Artifacts and sinks: Save outputs reliably with typed schemas and manifests.
- Ergonomics: Defaults, profiles, helpers for paths, naming, and monitoring.

Core concepts at a glance
-------------------------

```r
library(parade)

# Grid of inputs
grid <- data.frame(x = 1:4, group = rep(c("A", "B"), 2))

# Define a simple flow with one stage and an explicit return schema
fl <- flow(grid) |>
  stage("calc", function(x) x^2, schema = returns(result = dbl())) |>
  distribute(dist_local(by = "group"))

# Submit for deferred execution (local futures by default)
d <- submit(fl)

# Wait briefly and collect results
deferred_await(d, timeout = 30)
out <- deferred_collect(d)
out
```

When to use which surface
-------------------------

- Use the flow DSL when you want typed, multi-stage pipelines with sinks.
- Use the unified job API (`slurm_call()`, `slurm_map()/slurm_pmap()`) for
  quick function/script submission and jobset operations.

Distribution options
--------------------

- Local: `dist_local(by = ..., within = "multisession")` for multi-core.
- SLURM: `dist_slurm()` or `dist_slurm_profile()` when on a cluster.
- Mirai: `dist_mirai()` for high-performance clusters or SSH/TLS setups.

Artifacts and sinks (optional)
------------------------------

Define sinks in stages to write outputs to stable paths with format-specific
read/write. Start with temporary sinks during development; switch to project
paths (`artifacts://`) for production.
