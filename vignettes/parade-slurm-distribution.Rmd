## Introduction to distributed computing with parade

**parade** separates the **workflow definition** (DAG) from the **execution strategy** (distribution plan), allowing you to run the same computational pipeline locally for development or on SLURM clusters for production. This separation enables:

- **Local development**: Test workflows on your laptop with `dist_local()`
- **Cluster scaling**: Execute the same workflow on SLURM with `dist_slurm()`
- **Resource optimization**: Fine-tune parallelization and resource allocation
- **Flexible chunking**: Balance job granularity and scheduling efficiency

The key insight is that parade workflows are *portable* - you define your computation once and choose how to distribute it based on your current needs.

## Local vs. SLURM distribution strategies

### Local distribution for development

Before we switch to SLURM, it helps to understand what the distribution API does:

- `distribute()` attaches an execution strategy to a flow. The strategy does not
  change your DAG — it only controls how rows of the parameter grid are scheduled.
- `dist_local()` builds a local strategy (great for development) and lets you
  specify grouping (with `by`), the within‑job execution mode (`within`), and the
  amount of parallelism inside each job (`workers_within`).
- `dist_slurm()` does the same for a SLURM cluster (we cover it in the next section).

The `by` argument refers to column names in your parameter grid. In this vignette
we group by `subject`, so all rows for the same subject run in the same job.

If you want to “test on a subset,” simply filter your grid before building the flow
(for example, `grid_dev <- subset(grid, subject == "sub01")`). The code below keeps
the full grid and illustrates local parallelism.

```r
library(parade)
library(progressr)

# Initialize project structure
paths_init()

# Create a parameter grid
grid <- param_grid(
  subject = c("sub01", "sub02", "sub03"),
  session = 1:2,
  condition = c("A", "B")
) # Results in 12 rows (3×2×2)

# Define a simple workflow
fl <- flow(grid) |>
  stage("process", function(subject, session, condition) {
    # Simulate computational work
    Sys.sleep(runif(1, 0.1, 0.5))
    list(result = paste(subject, session, condition, sep = "_"))
  })

# Local development: run locally (optionally on a subset)
fl_local <- fl |>
  distribute(dist_local(
    by = "subject",           # Group by subject
    within = "multisession",  # Use parallel workers within each group  
    workers_within = 2        # Use 2 cores per group
  ))
```

### SLURM distribution for production

The same workflow can be scaled to a SLURM cluster:

```r
# Row-wise: one job per parameter combination
fl_rowwise <- fl |> distribute(dist_slurm(
  by = NULL,                                      # No grouping - each row is independent
  within = "multisession",                        # Parallel execution within each job
  workers_within = 4,                             # 4 workers per job
  resources = batch_resources(                    # SLURM resource specification
    nodes = 1, 
    cpus_per_task = 4, 
    time = "30min",
    mem = "8GB"
  ),
  chunks_per_job = 1                             # One parameter row per job
))

# Subject-wise: group related work into fewer jobs
fl_subject <- fl |> distribute(dist_slurm(
  by = "subject",                                 # Group by subject
  within = "multisession",                        # Parallel within each job
  workers_within = 8,                             # More workers since we're grouping
  resources = batch_resources(
    nodes = 1, 
    cpus_per_task = 8, 
    time = "2h",                                  # Longer time for grouped work
    mem = "16GB"
  ),
  chunks_per_job = 1                             # One subject per job
))
```

### Understanding grouping strategies

The `by` parameter controls how your parameter grid is partitioned:

- **`by = NULL`** (row-wise): Each parameter combination becomes a separate group
  - Pro: Maximum parallelization, fine-grained control
  - Con: Many small jobs, scheduling overhead
  - Best for: Independent tasks that benefit from dedicated resources

- **`by = "subject"`** (barrier groups): Group related parameter combinations  
  - Pro: Fewer jobs, shared setup costs, better resource utilization
  - Con: Less parallelization, potential load imbalance
  - Best for: Tasks that share expensive initialization (data loading, model setup)

## Resource allocation and optimization

### Understanding the parallelization hierarchy

parade provides two levels of parallelization control:

1. **Job-level parallelization**: How many SLURM jobs to submit
2. **Within-job parallelization**: How many tasks run concurrently within each job

```

> Tip: If you maintain named resource profiles (via `slurm_defaults_set()` or
> `profile_register()`), you can avoid boilerplate by using the convenience helper
> `dist_slurm_profile()`:
>
> ```r
> fl |> distribute(dist_slurm_profile("standard", by = "subject", workers_within = 8))
> ```
>
> This resolves the profile through `slurm_resources()` and fills the `resources`
> argument of `dist_slurm()` for you.
r
# Example: 24 parameter combinations, grouped by subject (3 subjects × 8 combinations each)
grid <- param_grid(
  subject = c("sub01", "sub02", "sub03"),
  session = 1:4, 
  run = 1:2
) # 24 total combinations

fl <- flow(grid) |> 
  stage("analyze", 
    f = function(subject, session, run) {
      # Simulate expensive computation
      set.seed(as.numeric(factor(subject)) * 100 + session * 10 + run)
      
      # Mock expensive matrix operations
      n <- 1000
      X <- matrix(rnorm(n * n), nrow = n)
      result <- svd(X, nu = 10, nv = 10)  # Partial SVD
      
      list(
        singular_values = result$d[1:10],
        subject = subject,
        session = session, 
        run = run
      )
    },
    schema = returns(
      singular_values = lst(),
      subject = chr(),
      session = int(),
      run = int()
    )
  )

# Strategy 1: One job per subject, parallel within
fl |> distribute(dist_slurm(
  by = "subject",                    # 3 jobs (one per subject)
  workers_within = 8,                # 8 parallel tasks per job
  chunks_per_job = 1,                # Each subject in one job
  resources = batch_resources(
    cpus_per_task = 8,               # Match workers_within
    time = "4h",
    mem = "32GB"
  )
))

# Strategy 2: Split large groups across multiple jobs
fl |> distribute(dist_slurm(
  by = "subject",                    # Group by subject first
  workers_within = 4,                # 4 parallel tasks per job  
  chunks_per_job = 2,                # Split each subject into 2 jobs
  resources = batch_resources(       # Results in 6 total jobs (3 subjects × 2)
    cpus_per_task = 4,               # Match workers_within
    time = "2h",                     # Shorter time per chunk
    mem = "16GB"
  )
))
```

### Throttling concurrent execution

The `workers_within` parameter acts like `xargs -P`, limiting concurrent tasks **within** each SLURM job:

```r
# Without throttling: all tasks run simultaneously (may overwhelm resources)
dist_slurm(by = "subject", workers_within = NULL)

# With throttling: limit to 4 concurrent tasks per job
dist_slurm(by = "subject", workers_within = 4)
```

**Guidelines for `workers_within`:**
- Match or slightly exceed `cpus_per_task` 
- Consider memory usage: `total_memory / workers_within` per task
- Account for I/O bottlenecks in shared filesystems
- Start conservatively and increase based on monitoring

## Advanced chunking strategies

### Optimizing job granularity

The `chunks_per_job` parameter controls how groups are split across SLURM jobs:

```r
# Large groups: split for better parallelization
grid <- param_grid(
  subject = "subject01",  # One subject
  trial = 1:1000          # But 1000 trials
)

fl <- flow(grid) |> 
  stage("process_trial", 
    f = function(subject, trial) {
      # Simulate trial-level analysis
      set.seed(trial)
      
      # Mock signal processing
      signal <- rnorm(1000)  # Simulated time series
      filtered <- filter(signal, rep(1/5, 5), sides = 2)  # Moving average
      
      # Extract features
      features <- list(
        mean_amplitude = mean(filtered, na.rm = TRUE),
        peak_value = max(filtered, na.rm = TRUE),
        variance = var(filtered, na.rm = TRUE)
      )
      
      list(
        subject = subject,
        trial = trial,
        features = features
      )
    },
    schema = returns(
      subject = chr(),
      trial = int(),
      features = lst()
    )
  )

# Split into smaller chunks for better scheduling
fl |> distribute(dist_slurm(
  by = "subject",                    # Group by subject
  chunks_per_job = 100,              # 100 trials per job → 10 jobs total
  workers_within = 4,                # 4 parallel trials per job
  resources = batch_resources(
    cpus_per_task = 4,
    time = "1h",                     # Shorter jobs are easier to schedule
    mem = "8GB"
  )
))
```

### Multi-dimensional grouping

```r
# Complex parameter space
grid <- param_grid(
  subject = c("s01", "s02", "s03"),
  condition = c("rest", "task"),
  session = 1:3
)

# Define workflow with actual computation
fl <- flow(grid) |>
  stage("analyze",
    f = function(subject, condition, session) {
      # Simulate fMRI analysis
      set.seed(as.numeric(factor(subject)) * 100 + 
               as.numeric(factor(condition)) * 10 + session)
      
      # Mock connectivity analysis
      n_regions <- 50
      timeseries <- matrix(rnorm(n_regions * 200), nrow = n_regions)
      correlation_matrix <- cor(t(timeseries))
      
      list(
        mean_connectivity = mean(correlation_matrix[upper.tri(correlation_matrix)]),
        subject = subject,
        condition = condition,
        session = session
      )
    },
    schema = returns(
      mean_connectivity = dbl(),
      subject = chr(),
      condition = chr(),
      session = int()
    )
  )

# Group by multiple columns
fl |> distribute(dist_slurm(
  by = c("subject", "condition"),    # One job per subject-condition pair
  workers_within = 3,                # Parallel across sessions  
  chunks_per_job = 1,
  resources = batch_resources(
    cpus_per_task = 3,
    time = "30min",
    mem = "4GB"
  )
))
```

## SLURM job submission and monitoring

### Deferred execution workflow

```r
# 1. Validate workflow locally (recommended)
preflight(fl_subject)

# 2. Submit to SLURM (returns immediately)
d <- submit(fl_subject, mode = "index")
```

The workflow is now running on the cluster. Use these commands to monitor progress:

```r
# Check job status
deferred_status(d, show_progress = TRUE)

# Monitor logs in real-time 
# Use scripts/parade_tail.R for continuous monitoring

# Collect completed results
results <- deferred_collect(d, how = "index")
```

### Resource specification examples

```r
# CPU-intensive tasks
resources <- batch_resources(
  partition = "standard",
  nodes = 1,
  cpus_per_task = 16,
  time = "4h",
  mem = "32GB"
)

# Memory-intensive tasks  
resources <- batch_resources(
  partition = "himem", 
  nodes = 1,
  cpus_per_task = 4,
  time = "8h", 
  mem = "128GB"
)

# GPU computing
resources <- batch_resources(
  partition = "gpu",
  nodes = 1,
  ntasks_per_node = 1,
  cpus_per_task = 8,
  gres = "gpu:1",
  time = "2h",
  mem = "24GB"
)

# Multi-node MPI (if supported by your workflow)
resources <- batch_resources(
  partition = "standard",
  nodes = 4,
  ntasks_per_node = 16, 
  time = "12h",
  mem = "64GB"
)
```

## Common patterns and best practices

### Pattern 1: Development → Production scaling

```r
# Define the analysis workflow once
analyze_workflow <- function(grid) {
  flow(grid) |>
    stage("preprocess",
      f = function(subject, session) {
        # Simulate preprocessing
        set.seed(as.numeric(factor(subject)) * 10 + session)
        data <- matrix(rnorm(1000 * 100), nrow = 1000)
        
        # Normalize and filter
        normalized <- scale(data)
        list(processed_data = normalized)
      },
      schema = returns(processed_data = lst())
    ) |>
    stage("analyze",
      needs = "preprocess",
      f = function(preprocess.processed_data) {
        # Run statistical analysis
        pca_result <- prcomp(preprocess.processed_data, rank. = 10)
        list(variance_explained = summary(pca_result)$importance[2, 1:10])
      },
      schema = returns(variance_explained = lst())
    )
}

# Development: quick test on subset
grid_dev <- param_grid(subject = "sub01", session = 1:2)
fl_dev <- analyze_workflow(grid_dev) |> 
  distribute(dist_local(workers_within = 2))

# Test locally
dev_results <- collect(fl_dev)
print(dev_results)  # Verify everything works

# Production: full dataset on cluster  
grid_prod <- param_grid(subject = sprintf("sub%02d", 1:100), session = 1:4)
fl_prod <- analyze_workflow(grid_prod) |> 
  distribute(dist_slurm(
    by = "subject",
    workers_within = 4,
    chunks_per_job = 1,
    resources = batch_resources(cpus_per_task = 4, time = "2h", mem = "16GB")
  ))
```

### Pattern 2: Adaptive chunking based on data size

```r
# Small datasets: group more aggressively
small_fl |> distribute(dist_slurm(
  by = "subject", 
  chunks_per_job = 1,        # One job per subject
  workers_within = 8         # High parallelism within job
))

# Large datasets: split into smaller chunks  
large_fl |> distribute(dist_slurm(
  by = "subject",
  chunks_per_job = 4,        # Split each subject across 4 jobs
  workers_within = 2         # Lower parallelism per job
))
```

## Common pitfalls and solutions

### Problem: Jobs fail with memory errors
**Solution**: Increase memory allocation or reduce `workers_within`:

```r
# Before: likely to exceed memory
dist_slurm(workers_within = 16, resources = batch_resources(mem = "8GB"))

# After: more conservative memory usage
dist_slurm(workers_within = 4, resources = batch_resources(mem = "8GB"))
# Now each task gets ~2GB instead of ~512MB
```

### Problem: Many short jobs overwhelming the scheduler  
**Solution**: Increase `chunks_per_job` to create fewer, longer-running jobs:

```r
# Before: 1000 small jobs
dist_slurm(by = NULL, chunks_per_job = 1)  # One job per parameter row

# After: 100 medium jobs
dist_slurm(by = NULL, chunks_per_job = 10)  # 10 parameter rows per job
```

### Problem: Load imbalance in grouped jobs
**Solution**: Use row-wise distribution or smaller chunks:

```r
# Before: uneven subject sizes cause load imbalance
dist_slurm(by = "subject", chunks_per_job = 1)

# After: more even distribution
dist_slurm(by = NULL, chunks_per_job = 5)  # 5 rows per job regardless of subject
```

### Problem: I/O bottlenecks on shared filesystems
**Solution**: Reduce concurrent tasks and consider I/O patterns:

```r
# Before: high I/O contention  
dist_slurm(workers_within = 32)

# After: reduced contention
dist_slurm(workers_within = 4)  # Fewer concurrent file operations
```
