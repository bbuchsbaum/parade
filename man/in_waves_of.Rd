\title{Submit jobs in waves with controlled parallelism}
\usage{
in_waves_of(size, wait = TRUE, delay = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{size}{Number of jobs per wave}

\item{wait}{Whether to wait for wave completion before next wave}

\item{delay}{Delay in seconds between waves (if wait = FALSE)}
}
\value{
A wave controller function
}
\description{
Wraps job submission functions to submit jobs in controlled batches,
useful for managing cluster load and resource availability.
}
\examples{
\donttest{
# Submit 100 jobs in waves of 10
jobs <- slurm_map(1:100, ~ .x^2, 
                  .options = in_waves_of(10))

# With delay between waves
jobs <- slurm_map(1:100, ~ .x^2,
                  .options = in_waves_of(10, wait = FALSE, delay = 60))
}
