  by = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{by}{Column names to group by for parallelization}

\item{within}{Execution strategy: "multisession", "multicore", "callr", or "sequential"}

\item{workers_within}{Number of workers within each job}

\item{chunks_per_job}{Number of groups to process per job.}

\item{target_jobs}{Optional integer; target number of jobs to create (overrides
\code{chunks_per_job} at submit time). Useful when you want to keep a fixed number
of jobs in flight regardless of how many groups exist.}

Configure local parallel execution using the future framework.
