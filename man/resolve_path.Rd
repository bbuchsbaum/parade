\alias{resolve_path}
\title{Resolve paths with URI-style aliases}
\usage{
resolve_path(x, create = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Path string potentially containing aliases}

\item{create}{Whether to create directories as needed}
}
\value{
Resolved absolute path
}
\description{
Resolves path strings that may contain URI-style aliases like
"data://input/file.csv" or "artifacts://results".
}
\details{
When \code{create = TRUE}, the function ensures that directory
targets exist. For file-like paths (those with extensions or leading dots),
only parent directories are created so the file path itself is left untouched.
}
\examples{
resolve_path("data://processed/output.rds", create = FALSE)
resolve_path("/absolute/path")
}
